# Project: Communicate Data Findings: USA Flights 1998 vs 2008

## <font color='gray'>Introduction</font>
The project is a part of Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree program that divided into two major parts. <br>
One for an exploratory data analysis and another for an explanatory data analysis. <br>
We got dataset reports flights in the United States, including carriers, arrival and departure delays, and reasons for delays. <br>
The results focus on data from 1980 and 2008 due to the main purpose, compare some flight activities after 10 years passing. <br>

## <font color='gray'>Summary</font>
- First of all, flights increased largely in a decade due to lifestyle of people and lower cost of energy so they directly effected to some flight hours
- From EDA we know that number of flights increased dramatically between 5:00 - 20:00 for departing and 7:00 - 24:00 for arriving
- The data shows only USA flights so most of them are domestic flights happened in 200 - 600 miles or 50 - 100 minutes air times
- Departure delay affected by month considerably they happened more minutes in June and December so the seasonal effect occured.
- The delay cycle seem to be changed in a decade that can see in the high average delays in December 2008 much higher than the same month of 1998
- Friday produced more delay than other days of week espeially in March, April, May and June
- Spreading of arrival delays were wider than departure delays due to the air times
- Petersburg James A. Johnson Airport (PSG) of Alaska was the home of widest range in arrival delays both 1998 and 2008
- Late of aircraft was the reason that had most correlation rate with other reasons so it might be the leading reason of delays
- Security delay is not related to other delay reasons
